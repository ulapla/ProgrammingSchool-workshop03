# Programming school - workshop 03
Technologies:
- Java
- Servlets
- JSP
- MySQL
I also used Dao classes with CRUD operations

This project is a simulation of a system for programming school. As an admin, you can manage (edit, add) groups, students and exercises. You can look at students' solutions for exercises or f.e. change their group id or personal data. 

You can see how it works here: http://ulapla.mooo.com:8080/
But you must know that it is pure HTML with JSP, so don't be surprised, it looks awful, but works perfectly ;)
